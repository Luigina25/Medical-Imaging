Networks are too big to be uploaded on GitHub, therefore there is a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ucfmfyq5BV9XNvvPFlwA5JQjxJ__9RKQ?usp=share_link) to a Google Drive Folder accessible to members of Universit√† degli Studi di Salerno

Scripts are organized in the following way:
  - train.py, predict.py, roc.py and matrix.py work on a single fold.
  - train.sh, predicts.sh, rocs.sh work on all the five folds.

The training folder contains utility files for the training phase.
